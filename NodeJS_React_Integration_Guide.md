# Node.js and React Integration Guide

## Overview of the Architecture
- **Client-Server Architecture**: React acts as the client, while Node.js serves as the backend. They communicate over HTTP.

## Setting Up the Node.js Backend
1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Create a New Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-node-backend
   cd my-node-backend
   npm init -y
   ```
3. **Install Express.js**:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

## Creating API Endpoints
- **Basic Server Setup**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   app.use(express.json());

   app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
       res.json({ message: 'Hello from Node.js!' });
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

## Connecting React to Node.js
1. **Make HTTP Requests**:
   - Install Axios in your React project:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
   - Example of making a GET request:
   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';

   const fetchData = async () => {
       const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/hello');
       console.log(response.data);
   };
   ```

## Testing the Integration
- Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
- Handle responses and errors in your React app appropriately.

## Conclusion
This guide provides a basic understanding of how to connect a Node.js backend with a React frontend. You can expand upon this foundation by adding more complex features and endpoints as needed.
